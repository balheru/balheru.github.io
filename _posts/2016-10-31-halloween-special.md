# Part 1 -   The Campfire

>We have always been afraid of the dark.
More specifically we have always been afraid of the unknown.
There is something special about our relationship with the unknown.
Through trial, error and great pain, we have managed to push away this
problematic issue. We discovered fire, and the night was forever pushed
back. We feared the elements, and we mastered them, plagues have decimated
us, and we fought back with medicine. The fear of the unknown has been our
greatest motivator to push back the darkness. I wonder, if all this time
we were allowed to grow out of the dark ages, for the amusement of those
beings that go bumping in the night.
