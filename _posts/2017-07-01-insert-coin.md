# Bonkers & Free

> Rickshank Redemption

Man, i cannot believe what a headache you get from a straight day of drinking & bad eating.

I mean i think i basically drank a full case of beer & bottle of booze.

This in retrospect was a very bad idea, drinking with the stupid ass gang is horrible for your liver. I have no incentive to stop drinking once i start, & the rest of those people have *reasons* to drink, bad combo.

I should nickname my liver Jesus, cause after it dies, i resurrects itself a few days later. In the process i suffer a little bit, but hey, you get what you pay for.

I still do not understand how i can put myself through this.

## Reset Button

Drenching your brain in alcohol, it is a very unrecommended thing. But somehow it has some restorative properties to my brain.

Jesus, this is a sad realization, the only way that i get a productive streak in me is by completely bombing my neurons in paint thinner.

I guess it is important to find yourself your personal reset button, but still, why does mine have to be so brutal.

I wonder if there is a way to find your reset button other than an incredibly bad couple of days to fix your mental state.

## Sleep Cycle

The worst would probably be the sorry state of my sleeping schedule, i've been experiencing mood swings and huge imbalances in my perception, and i think it is due to the deregulation of my circadian rhythm.
