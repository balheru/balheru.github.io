# Long Nights Spent In Mania

>{Wonderland-Limes}

It is the early hours of the morning, my back is in quite big amounts of discomfort.

A few days earlier, i went to a chiropractor and had my spine *Readjusted Thoroughly*, and now i am only comfortable on a position lying down on my back. No longer am i allowed to assume the most deliciously comfy position on earth, what i like to call the flat soldier.

I have been very stiff for a very long time and i have had difficulty cracking my back and neck to release tension, and i seem to be compensating for the lost months, if not years, i have not stopped popping and crackling for two days straight. Though i feel as if i have two massive bruises on the inside of my cervical vertebrae, and they are sensitive to chilly situations, giving me instant pain and dizziness. What joy.

The beauty of today though, is that i am finding very stylish sources of inspiration, at least on a design level, from old school book cover art to all sorts of awesome artists such as *Justin Van Genderen*, and some yummy art all over the place, for some reason consuming art is refreshing.
