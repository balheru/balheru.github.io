# Shit Coffee, Shit Internet, & Fucking Glare

>Honestly, if this is the lifestyle of someone who works in the tech industry it is horrible.

So now i think i have finally found a resource that meets my specific needs, as well as what i am going to add on top of this.

It's from freecodecamp. And it has what i want:

- Front End Dev(400h)
- Data Visualization(400h)
- Back End Dev(400h)
- Project(800h)

For a grand total of 2000+ hours of delicious coding.
