# Being an Idiot is Funny Sometimes

Today i failed at a the very simple act of attending a meeting. Quite frustrated as this just demonstrates my lack of discipline and organization.

I mean how is it that in todays day and age of the tricorder, that i still forget important things.

I think it might boil down to a few things.
- I do not process inputs to my schedule properly
- I do not prune and maintain my calendar properly either
- I do not have it in my routine to check my calendar whatsoever.
This nice trifecta is kinda the worse system ever, there is no input to my system, no maintenance of it, & especially no verification of it.

I must figure out a way to commit to a scheduling system.
