# The Hourglass Man’s Letter

Darkness has befallen us.

The great lineage of our family is now teetering on the precipice of oblivion. I hope that this letter has managed to reach our only remaining allies, else all our efforts shall be for naught.

We have been hunting a great *Shade* for many years now, it’s tenebrous tracks spreading death & devastation wherever it treads. That blasted *Shade* finally seemed to settle in a frontier town called *The Blue Dandelion*. The town folk at first seemed to be humble folk, their village beset by an uncommonly harsh winter & poor harvest, yet still their stoicism & eerie cheerfulness steeled our hearts.

We could not have been further from the truth, be weary my friends, nothing is what it truly seems to be.

Few bear the *Three Cross Sigil* of our clan of *Hunters*. We are trapped, and this is our last effort to escape our chains.

You may be our final hope.

Grazen,
Grand Master of The Hourglass
