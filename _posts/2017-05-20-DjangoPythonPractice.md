# The Workload Of The Day

Today was a rather interesting exercise in upkeep.

The first thing that i have done is brush myself up on organizational issues, & did a small clean up of my files, while my whole computer probably needs to be nuked & a fresh start started, thatâ€™s a very long process.

I have bypassed this by setting up virtual environments & learning how to use them, this compartmentalizes my dependencies & allows me to fck up less as i chase down mistakes a lot less often.

What i decided to do was to follow a django/python [tutorial] & pile through the tutorial, i spent the better part of 3 hours on it, & i have managed to have success somewhere down the line, definitely i will need to have a more in depth mastery of a few things:

- Github & command line Git
- Django commands
- MySQL

But besides that i have managed nicely i think today & i am happy that i moved forward quite far.
